## Introduction
Expense Tracker is a simple yet powerful application built using Dart Flutter that allows users to track their expenses conveniently on their mobile devices. Unlike many expense tracker apps, Expense Tracker prioritizes privacy by storing all data locally on the user's device. This means that no data is stored on any server, and if the app is uninstalled, all data is wiped out and cannot be recovered.

## Installation
1. **Download**: The app can be downloaded from the [Google Play Store](#) or [Apple App Store](#), depending on your device's operating system.
2. **Installation**: Follow the on-screen instructions to install the app on your device.

2. **Set up**: Follow the prompts to set up your expense categories and any initial configurations.

## Features
- **Expense Tracking**: Easily add, edit, and delete expenses.
- **Local Data Storage**: All expense data is stored locally on your device, ensuring privacy and security.
